                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    An operating system (OS) is the fundamental software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware, enabling smooth interaction and efficient resource utilization. Operating systems are essential for the functioning of all modern computing devices, from smartphones and tablets to personal computers and servers.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The primary functions of an operating system include managing hardware resources, providing a user interface, handling file systems, and ensuring security. As technology has evolved, operating systems have become increasingly complex, offering a wide range of features and capabilities to meet the diverse needs of users and applications.
